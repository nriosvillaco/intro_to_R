## Introduction

This repository serves as a compilation of code samples and scripts created during my Intro to R programming class. It's designed to provide examples of different concepts, techniques, and applications covered in the course.

## Repository Contents

The repository is organized as follows:

- `assignments/`: Contains scripts and code related to assignments.
- `exams/`: Contains scripts used for exam questions.
- `quizzes/`: Includes code snippets and scripts used in class quizzes.
- `data/`: Contains sample files and output datasets used in the scripts.
- `README.md`: The document you are currently reading, providing an overview of the repository.

Feel free to explore the different directories to access the code samples and data files.

## Usage

You can use this repository as a reference for various R programming concepts and techniques. Feel free to study, modify, and experiment with the code to deepen your understanding of R programming.

## Data

The `data/` directory contains sample datasets used in the code samples. These datasets were employed to illustrate data manipulation, analysis, and visualization techniques taught in the class. You can use them to practice working with real-world data.

## Contributing

While this repository primarily serves as a personal collection of code samples, contributions are welcome! If you have corrections, improvements, or additional code examples related to the R programming class, feel free to submit a pull request.

Happy coding and learning with R programming!
